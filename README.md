# Windspeed
Dataset Introduction
This dataset focuses on meteorological elements such as wind speed. It encompasses rich meteorological data from 2019, and is of great reference value for fields such as meteorological research and wind power generation.
 
The data meticulously records the wind speed and direction at different heights of the anemometer towers, including the wind speed and direction information at 10m, 30m, 50m heights of the anemometer towers and at the hub height. It also covers meteorological data such as temperature, air pressure, and humidity, providing a comprehensive picture of the meteorological conditions.
 
The data is recorded at 15 - minute intervals, precisely capturing the dynamic changes of meteorological elements. It can reflect the fluctuations of meteorological conditions in a short period, providing highly time - sensitive data support for short - term meteorological analysis and prediction.
